You need to perform the following tasks:

1. **Find Best Scene Duration per Movie:** Write a JavaScript function that iterates through each movie’s bestScenes array and finds the scene with the longest duration. Return an object containing the movie name and the longest scene’s duration. (e.g., { movieName: “The Shawshank Redemption”, longestSceneDuration: 15 })
2. **Average Rating with Reduce:** Utilize the reduce method to calculate the average movie rating based on the provided ratings.
3. **Sort Movie List:** Explain how you would achieve sorting the movie list in JavaScript. You have to sort by rating (descending) and movie name (alphabetical).
